# blackjack
Blackjack program created for SWE I application with Praeses.

This is my implementation of the card game Blackjack (https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/).
Beyond the core game rules, I have implemented betting and local multiplayer. 

My program can be run with the command `java -jar blackjack.jar num_players`. If no player argument is provided, the game will default to single-player.
Source code and most recent class files have also been included.

Thank you for your consideration! I look forward to discussing my program with you all.
